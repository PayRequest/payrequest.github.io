The couple of months we have worked hard to restyle our dashboard, to make it more easy for businesses to accept payments,
and to create their own payment page.

<br />

##   What's new in our Dashboard
We have done our best not to make extensive changes, because our dashboard should remain simple, 
but everything looks a lot more modern, and we have added many new functions.

<br />

### Bootstrap 5
We updated our toolkit Bootstrap from 4 tot 5, this was a challenge because all pages had to be redesigned.

<br />

### Real-time Search
A great new feature is our real-time search option, here you can search through all your requests,transactions and customers.

## New Request 2.0
Our most important page is the new request page, here you can create new payment requests, we have restyled this page,
and make it more easy to create a payment link in less then 1 minutes.

## Onboarding (for new customers)
To help new customers set up their account, we've set up an entire onboarding page,
where they can choose their payrequest.me name and connect Stripe, so they can immediately start making payments.
