##   Changelog Improved Dashboard 2021
Last months wer worked hard to improve our dashboard,


### Bootstrap 5
We updated our toolkit Bootrap from 4 tot 5, this was a challenge because all pages had to be redesigned.


### Real-time Search
A great new feature is our real-time search option, here you can search through all your requests,transactions and customers.

and make it more easy to create a payment link in less then 1 minutes.
