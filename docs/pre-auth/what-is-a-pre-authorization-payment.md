                     <h2>How Do Pre Authorization Payments
<span>Work?</span>

</h2>
                  </div>

<h3>
    When you make a traditional payment using a credit or debit card, the money is immediately withdrawn from your account and the purchase amount is subtracted from your available balance. Pre authorization payments work by placing a temporary hold on the funds in your account, with the actual withdrawal of said funds taking place later on.
</h3>

<h4> Pre authorization payments can be confusing if you aren't familiar with them, but they're used by lots of different businesses. </h4>

<h3> The whole idea behind pre authorization payments is to make sure customers are paying for goods and services. Once a pre authorization payment has been made, the funds for that payment are unavailable until the payment goes through. Think of pre authorization payments as a sort of security deposit; if a customer decides they don't want to pay, a pre authorization payment allows you to get the money that's owed to you. Not only does this ensure you get the money you're rightfully owed for goods and services, but it can also save you a lot of trouble when it comes to payment processing. </h3>

                     <h2>Benefits of 
<span>Pre Authorization Payments</span>

</h2>
                  </div>

<h3>Obviously, the biggest benefit of pre authorization payments is the fact that they allow you to secure funds in exchange for goods and services. However, you also don't have to worry about the hassle of things like refunds and chargebacks. If you need to give a customer a refund, you can simply cancel the pre authorization payment before the funds are actually withdrawn. This means it's easy to provide refunds and your customers will be happy since they don't have to wait 3 to 5 business days for a refund.
